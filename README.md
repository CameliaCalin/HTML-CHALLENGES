Frontend Learning Journey
Welcome to my Frontend Development Exercises Repository! ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™ve recently embarked on my journey to become a frontend developer, using Codecademy as my main learning resource. This repository is where Iâ€™m uploading my progress, exercises, and projects as I build up my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ“š Projects and Exercises
Fashion Blog (by Codecademy): A simple fashion blog project designed to help me learn the basics of HTML structure and CSS styling.

Wine Festival Schedule: A project that focuses on building a schedule for a wine festival using HTML and CSS to create an organized and visually appealing event page.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of this repository
This repository tracks my progress as I complete various frontend development exercises. It serves as a showcase of the projects Iâ€™m working on while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it will continue to grow as I develop my skills further.
